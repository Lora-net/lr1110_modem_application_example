# LR1110 modem demo application

## 1. Description

The LR1110 modem demo application project contains several simple examples highlighting lr1110 modem features :

- Simple LoRaWAN Class A application 868/915 MHz:
	- The app joins automatically the LoRa Network server then sends uplinks periodically with the interval defined by APP_TX_DUTYCYCLE
- Simple GNSS example :
	- The unix date in ASCII is asked to the user through a terminal, once the date is received by the modem, it executes a GNSS scan periodically according to the gnss settings defined in the application
- Simple Wi-Fi example :
	- The modem executes a Wi-Fi scan periodically according to the Wi-Fi settings defined in the application
- Simple Tx continuous app :
	- The modem starts to send continuous wave
- Tracker example :
	- The app joins automatically the network then periodically :
		- Perform a Wi-Fi Scan
		- Perform a GNSS scan, the alcsync is needed
		- Stream the scan results
